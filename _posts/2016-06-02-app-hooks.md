![Mergado vs. App communication]({{ "../assets/img/developers_hooks_vs_api.jpg" }}){: .blue-image }

## What is a hook?

Your app communicates with Mergado via [our API](https://mergado.docs.apiary.io/). In exchange, Mergado also needs to **actively communicate with your app**.

This is done via *web hooks*, which Mergado - at certain situations - calls upon your app's hook endpoints. To be specific, these *hooks* are *HTTP POST requests* with certain JSON (content type `application/json`) payload that specifies the hook's nature.

{: .message.info}
**Note:** By default, all apps are assigned with a hook URL similar to this:
`https://appcloud.mergado.com/apps/myveryappwow/hook/`. You can manage your app's hook URL via your app's *Storage* page in [Developers](https://developers.mergado.com).

### Example

Imagine a situation, where an app is being turned off by its user. Typically, the app might have created a bunch of rules, elements and other *"soon-to-be-unwanted-garbage"* during the time it was enabled. This is one of the typical use cases for *hooks* - and in our example, it's up to the developer of the app to clean up this built-up garbage.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th class="w20">What Mergado sends</th>
            <th class="w20">Its meaning</th>
            <th class="w60">What your app should do</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr>
        <td>
<div markdown="1">

```json
{
    "action": "app.disable",
    "entity_id": 42,
    "entity_type": "shop",
    "user_id": 123,
    "user_locale": "sk_SK"
}
```
</div>

        </td>
        <td>
            Someone disabled your app for shop <code>42</code>.
        </td>
        <td>
            <p>Use Mergado API to clean up after your app.</p> You might want to erase rules, queries, elements, etc. it created during its lifetime. You also might want to make a note that your app no longer needs to run CRON jobs for this e-shop <i>(as it would be pointless to do from now on)</i>, etc. Generally speaking, this is the time for cleaning up both Mergado and also your app's database.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>


## Data

The specific data along with a hook are entirely up to the type of the hook that is being called. Thus, any logic that handles a hook should assume data structure based solely on hook's `action` field.

```json
{
    "action": "app.enable",
    "entity_id": 42,
    "entity_type": "shop",
    "user_id": 234,
    "user_locale": "cs_CZ"
}
```

Here, as an example, because the field `action` contains `app.enable`, we can now safely assume that data will also contain fields `entity_id` and `entity_type`. We know that Mergado is calling this hook because someone enabled your app for `e-shop` with ID `42`.

You can find the list of all hooks along with their possible data fields [down below](#list-of-hooks).

## Response

A hook is considered *properly* handled if Mergado receives back a `2xx` HTTP response. Hooks returning a `4xx` HTTP response are considered to be handled *improperly* and that can either be evaluated as an error or can be safely ignored by Mergado, based on the nature of the hook. Lastly, a hook is considered to be *erroneous* when there is `5xx` HTTP response and such situations are always considered an error.

## Security

Every time Mergado sends a hook, the request will contain a special HTTP header `Mergado-Apps-Webhook-Secret` with a specific secret string that is **unique** to each app and each of its envs. This is true for all webhooks and for all *app-rule* based requests, too.

You can find all of your app's webhook secret values in [Developers](https://developers.mergado.com).

{: .message}
**Warning:** Developers are *strongly* advised to **always check the correct value of this HTTP header** to secure the app's hook endpoint against unauthorized access from any malicious third-parties.

## List of hooks
Below is the list of currently implemented hooks that can be invoked on your app by Mergado.

### `ping`
A test hook that can be sent from app's Developers page. This hook is successfully handled when the app returns a HTTP response `2xx` and a JSON containing field `message` with the value of `pong`.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Hook</th>
            <th>OK response</th>
            <th>Error response</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr>
        <td>
<div markdown="1">

```json
{
    "action": "ping"
}
```

</div>
    </td>
    <td>
<div markdown="1">

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
    "message": "pong"
}
```

</div>
        </td>
    <td>
<div markdown="1">

```break
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
```

</div>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

### `app.enable`

Called when app is being **enabled**. If this hook is properly handled *(i.e. app returns HTTP code `2xx`)*, app is going to be enabled. Otherwise *(HTTP codes `4xx` or `5xx`)* the app is not allowed to be enabled. If such cases optional JSON with a `message` field can be returned and this message will be then reported back to the user *(eg. reasons why the app currently cannot be enabled)*.

**Parameters**

- `entity_id`: ID of entity (based on type) for which the app is being enabled.
- `entity_type`: Type of entity. Values can be `user`, `shop` or `project`.
- `user_id`: ID of the user enabling this app.
- `user_locale`: Locale of the user enabling the app, e.g. `cs_CZ`, `sk_SK`, `en_GB`, etc.

### `app.disable`

Called when app is being **disabled**. If this hook is properly handled *(i.e. app returns HTTP code `2xx`)*, app is going to be disabled.
